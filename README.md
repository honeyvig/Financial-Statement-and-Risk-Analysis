# Financial-Statement-and-Risk-Analysis
Python script template for an AI/ML tool for financial statement analysis and risk management. It incorporates key features such as financial data ingestion, basic analysis, and a risk scoring model using machine learning. This example assumes the use of a Django-based web application for the front-end/backend and leverages key Python libraries for machine learning and financial analysis.
Python Script for Financial Statement Analysis & Risk Management
1. Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model analyzes financial statements and assigns a risk score.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import joblib

def train_risk_model(data_path: str, model_save_path: str):
    """
    Train a risk scoring model using financial statement data.

    Args:
        data_path (str): Path to the dataset CSV file.
        model_save_path (str): Path to save the trained model.

    Returns:
        str: Summary of the model's performance.
    """
    # Load financial data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)
    
    # Assuming the dataset has features and a target column 'Risk_Level'
    features = data.drop(columns=["Risk_Level"])
    target = data["Risk_Level"]

    # Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

    # Train Random Forest model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

    # Save the trained model
    joblib.dump(model, model_save_path)

    return f"Model trained successfully. Performance report:\n{report}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(train_risk_model("financial_data.csv", "risk_model.pkl"))

2. Financial Analysis

A function for basic financial ratio calculations.

def calculate_financial_ratios(data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Calculate basic financial ratios.

    Args:
        data (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with financial statement columns (e.g., Total Revenue, Total Assets, etc.).

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with calculated ratios.
    """
    data["Debt_to_Equity"] = data["Total Liabilities"] / data["Shareholders' Equity"]
    data["Current_Ratio"] = data["Current Assets"] / data["Current Liabilities"]
    data["Profit_Margin"] = data["Net Income"] / data["Total Revenue"]
    data["ROA"] = data["Net Income"] / data["Total Assets"]
    return data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example financial data
    financial_data = pd.DataFrame({
        "Total Revenue": [100000, 150000],
        "Total Liabilities": [50000, 80000],
        "Shareholders' Equity": [50000, 70000],
        "Current Assets": [40000, 50000],
        "Current Liabilities": [20000, 30000],
        "Net Income": [10000, 20000],
        "Total Assets": [100000, 200000],
    })
    print(calculate_financial_ratios(financial_data))

3. Django Integration

A basic Django view that integrates the above components.

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import JsonResponse
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Load the trained risk model
model = joblib.load("risk_model.pkl")

def analyze_financials(request):
    """
    Analyze financial statements and predict risk level.
    """
    if request.method == "POST":
        # Assuming the request contains JSON data
        data = pd.DataFrame(request.json)
        
        # Calculate ratios
        data_with_ratios = calculate_financial_ratios(data)
        
        # Predict risk level
        features = data_with_ratios.drop(columns=["Risk_Level"], errors='ignore')
        risk_predictions = model.predict(features)
        
        # Add predictions to the DataFrame
        data_with_ratios["Predicted_Risk_Level"] = risk_predictions
        
        return JsonResponse(data_with_ratios.to_dict(orient="records"), safe=False)
    
    return JsonResponse({"error": "Only POST requests are allowed."})

Features Covered

    Financial Statement Analysis:
        Calculates key financial ratios such as Debt-to-Equity, Current Ratio, Profit Margin, and ROA.

    Risk Management:
        Trains a machine learning model (Random Forest) to assign risk scores based on historical financial data.

    Full-Stack Framework:
        Django integration for creating a user-friendly web interface.
        Endpoints to analyze financial statements dynamically.

    Tools and Libraries:
        Python: Core logic, data handling, and machine learning.
